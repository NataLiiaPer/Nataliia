//    Create a Student class that has the same fields and methods as the
//    Person class, and has the following additional
//
//        fields:
//        previousOrganization: the name of the studentâ€™s previous company / school
//        skippedDays: the number of days skipped from the course
//        methods:

//        getGoal(): prints out "Be a junior software developer."

//        introduce(): "Hi, I'm name, a age year old gender from previousOrganization" +
//        " who skipped skippedDays days from the course already."

//        skipDays(numberOfDays): increases skippedDays by numberOfDays

//        The Student class has the following constructors:
//
//        Student(name, age, gender, previousOrganization): beside the given parameters,
//        it sets skippedDays to 0
//        Student(): sets name to Jane Doe, age to 30, gender to female,
//        previousOrganization to The School of Life, skippedDays to 0
